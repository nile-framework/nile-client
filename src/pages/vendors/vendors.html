    Vendors are close to done on this app. I need to spend a few hours finishing up the creation process for vendors from the admin app before I give them a UI face on this app. Also note that it will be very easy to switch out chosing a vendor and job site for the pickup and drop off locations rather than the random address that you can select right now.
